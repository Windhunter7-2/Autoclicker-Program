# Autoclicker Program
This will by far be the biggest project of these, and the one that I’ve already started the programming of. The most important part about this program is that it will support easily generatable autoclickers for a user, support any number of autoclickers from a user-generated library that will be existing, and users will be able to easily use any autoclicker, as well as easily create any autoclicker.

One such function of ease is that users will be able to easily create menus for their autoclickers, being able to customize the layout of their autoclickers, even to the extent of supporting user profiles and preset customized layouts. Users will also easily be able to “load” or “save” any autoclickers, as well.

Initial Autoclickers to Create for the User-Generated Library (Some of These Were Requested):

- Super Smash Bros. Brawl mods various autoclickers -> Exporting/importing to and from Blender (Both models and animations), turning a pose from Brawlbox into a portrait, an autoclicker for my material copier for single-click material generation of any kind

- Elder Scrolls mods various autoclickers -> Blender exporting/importing of models to Morrowind (Including rigged models)

- Some Blender autoclickers -> Deleting all vertex groups of a model part, a model rigger based on input of joint locations, converting multiple UVs and textures into one (Or vice versa)

- Some texture autoclickers -> Texture baker to combine normals and speculars and such into one texture

- Mod swapout autoclickers -> For various games, have a clicker that you can specify to install particular mods over particular characters and such, and this will automatically do it for batches, rather than needing to understand the game’s file structure to the user; especially useful for Project Recolor (A gigantic mod project of mine)

- N64 game model extractor -> Extract models from N64 games via Lemmy’s Plugin

Another function of this program will be that it will support autoclickers as macros. For instance, the user could set it up that when he presses ‘G’ on the keyboard and the program is running, that the autoclicker he linked to the key runs.
